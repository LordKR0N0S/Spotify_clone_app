I created a Spotify clone app using React.js, Redux Toolkit, and Tailwind CSS. Through developing this app, I gained a solid understanding of Redux Toolkit and its ability to make state manipulation throughout the app easy. RTK Query also simplified API calls. Although I used Tailwind CSS for the first time, I was impressed with its capabilities and plan to continue using it for styling future apps.
